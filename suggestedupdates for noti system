You'll need additional key components for a complete implementation:
First, you need a centralized event management system:
javascriptCopy// src/config/events.js
This file should contain all event constants used across the handlers, ensuring consistent event naming and making maintenance easier.
You also need specialized middleware:
javascriptCopy// src/middleware/socketAuth.js
This handles socket authentication, token verification, and role-based access control specifically for socket connections.
For real-time features, you'll need dedicated managers:
javascriptCopy// src/managers/roomManager.js
This handles socket room management, ensuring users join appropriate rooms based on their roles and relationships.
javascriptCopy// src/managers/presenceManager.js
This tracks online/offline status of users, particularly important for merchants and drivers.
For error handling and monitoring:
javascriptCopy// src/utils/socketErrorHandler.js
This provides centralized error handling for socket events, including error logging and client notification.
For real-time analytics:
javascriptCopy// src/services/analyticsService.js
This tracks real-time metrics and performance data across all socket interactions.
You'll also need integration helpers:
javascriptCopy// src/integrations/whatsappIntegration.js
// src/integrations/emailIntegration.js
These provide standardized interfaces for external service communication.
For data validation:
javascriptCopy// src/validators/socketEventValidators.js
This ensures all socket events receive properly formatted data.
For testing:
javascriptCopy// src/tests/socket/
This directory should contain comprehensive socket event tests, including connection handling, event emission, and error scenarios.
The most critical missing piece is a Redis implementation for socket scaling:
javascriptCopy// src/config/redis.js
This enables socket.io clustering for handling multiple server instances.
Finally, you need lifecycle hooks:
javascriptCopy// src/hooks/socketLifecycle.js
This manages socket connection lifecycle events, including cleanup on disconnection.
