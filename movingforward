Immediate Actions:
Model and Migration Synchronization Audit

Review existing models: Inspect current model definitions for accuracy and completeness.
Compare with migration files: Ensure field types, relationships, and attributes match between models and migrations.
Verify Mermaid (.md) documentation: Cross-check that entity relationships and model attributes are accurately represented.
Model-Migration-Documentation Alignment

Systematic verification workflow:
Validate model schema integrity.
Check migration script integrity (ensure reversible migrations and data handling).
Assess Mermaid diagrams for accuracy.
Cross-reference matrix creation: Document attributes, migration scripts, and entity relationships.
Synchronization protocol: Implement a process to ensure updates across models, migrations, and documentation stay consistent.
Model Refinement and Standardization

Correct existing models: Address discrepancies, improve naming conventions, and ensure proper relationship declarations.
Enhance validation: Implement robust field validation rules where necessary.
Update documentation: Add comments and details on model attributes and relationships.
Detailed Model Requirements Analysis

Catalog current and projected models: Create an inventory of all models (existing and required).
Define attribute specifications: Detail all necessary attributes for each model.
Map inter-model relationships: Ensure all model connections (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) are correctly established.
Document business logic: Outline complex business rules that models enforce.
Develop a data dictionary: Ensure clear definitions for all data fields.
Create a relationship dependency graph: Visualize how models depend on each other.
Set Up the Foundation:

Address essential foundational components before adding features, ensuring model and migration integrity.

Environment Setup

CI/CD Pipeline Configuration: Set up GitHub Actions or equivalent CI/CD workflows for automated deployment.
Database Migrations & Seeders: Ensure migrations are in place for all models and seeders for initial data.
Environment-Specific Configurations: Organize environment configurations for different stages (development, testing, production).
Docker Support (Optional): Implement Dockerfiles and docker-compose for containerization.
Documentation Needs

Comprehensive Documentation: Ensure system architecture, APIs, database schema, security, and deployment guides are properly documented.
Update Mermaid Diagrams: Keep the entity relationship diagrams up-to-date with current changes.
Incremental Feature Development Strategy (Post-Setup)
Micro-Feature Development: Develop and test small feature units one at a time, ensuring each new feature aligns with the existing models.
Comprehensive Testing: Test each feature independently before integration into the broader system.
